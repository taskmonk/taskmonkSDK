Currently supported clients are Python and JAVA. The individual directories have a README with more information. Streaming support is available only with JAVA client. 

Taskmonk uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials (https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) for authorisation. The client_id and client_secret need to be obtained from Taskmonk.
